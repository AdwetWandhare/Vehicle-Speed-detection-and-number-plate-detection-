# Vehicle-Speed-detection-and-number-plate-detection-
This is my college Minor Project , this project is Capable if Tracking vehicle speed , checking if it exceeds the speed limit , It tracks down the number plate of vehicles who exceeded speed limit and logs the data into a csv file .
Tools like Oppencv , Easyocr ,Numpy etc are used here for performing computer vision and computation of speed , here OPenCV was majorly used for computer vision or taacking vehicles , Numpy was used to calculate there Speed and EasyOCR to Extract Number plate from input .
Python Language was used  to create this , while its frontend was created in HTML and CSS , Insteaad of API , Traditional Frmework FLask was used in this project .
